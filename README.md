# vis-dashboard

Cute lil dashboard I made in Processing during Paul Rosen's data visualization course as an undergrad. 

All of the components are fully linked (hovering over a data point in the bar chart also hovers over the same point in the line chart, etc.) and selecting a scatterplot in the matrix will display the full size on the right.
